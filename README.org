#+texinfo_dir_desc: Extensions and application menus based on transient

* Introduction
This package provides a set of extensions to [[https://github.com/magit/transient/][transient]] and interactive menus
to common UNIX tools and applications.

* transient-extras-lp
#+CAPTION: Printing menu
[[file:screenshots/transient-extras-lp.png]]

=transient-extras-lp= provides a menu based on [[https://github.com/magit/transient/][transient]] to call the CUPS
printing program =lp= on the current buffer or a selected file.

=transient-extras-lp= can be enabled for =dired= and [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools/][pdf-tools]] buffers as follows
(make sure that =transient-extras.el= is in ~load-path~)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'transient-extras-lp)

  (with-eval-after-load 'dired
    (define-key
      dired-mode-map
      (kbd "C-c C-p") #'transient-extras-lp-menu))

  (with-eval-after-load 'pdf-tools
    (define-key
      pdf-misc-minor-mode-map
      (kbd "C-c C-p") #'transient-extras-lp-menu))
#+end_src

Or simply call =transient-extras-lp-menu= to print the current buffer or the selected
files in =dired=. If a buffer has an associated file, the file is printed,
otherwise the buffer content is sent to =lp=.

** Additional Configuration
By pressing =d=, you can input the name of the printer. The command =lpstat
-a= is used to get a list of installed and network printers. If you have
[[https://github.com/haji-ali/async-completing-read][async-completing-read]] installed then the command will be run asynchronously.

* transient-extras-a2ps

=transient-extras-a2ps= provides a menu to call the a2ps printing
program on the current buffer or selected file.

=transient-extras-a2ps= may be enabled for dired or other buffers
using the following code (assuming =transient-extras.el= is in the
~load-path~):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'transient-extras-a2ps)

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-p") #'transient-extras-a2ps)
#+end_src

Note that this binding will be shadowed in places where it is
specifically bound in a local map.

** Additional Configuration

All additional configuration and description of options may be found
in [[info:a2ps][the a2ps info manual]].
